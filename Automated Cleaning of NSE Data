rm(list=ls())  ##clean the working environment

setwd("") ## set the directory/folder path to where only 2 input files are saved i.e. NSE Combined report, NSE bhavcopy

## A little overkill step but helps considering only one package is required.

pack.req <- c( "dplyr")  
pack.check <- pack.req[!(pack.req %in% installed.packages()[,"Package"])]; if(length(pack.req)) install.packages(pack.req)

## Above step sometimes may require Restart of R so user discretion advised
